# Connecting to the Remote Desktops at UCSD
***
**Welcome to CSE 15L!** Throughout the quarter in CSE 15L, you will likely want or need to connect to a remote desktop to work on your programming assignments. While this may take a few steps, it is a very simple process!

**STEP 1**

Make sure to download the program [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to start the process of connecting your UCSD account to the remote terminal.

When you get to the webpage for Visual Studio Code, press the download button at the top right corner and choose the operating system of the computer you are using. This is what the webpage should look like:

Once you have finished downloading Visual Studio Code, start by opening the application. 

**Important:** If you are using Windows *like me!* you need to also download [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) before creating a terminal. 

When you are ready to continue, it is time to create a new terminal. You can do this by clicking the "terminal" drop down menu on the top left of the Visual Studio Code application, as shown in the image below:

Once you have opened the terminal, you are only one step away from being ready to remotely access the UCSD desktops. You may have noticed that your terminal should say "powershell". It is important to change this to "bash" before attempting to log in to your UCSD account. The following image depicts where and how you can make this change:
